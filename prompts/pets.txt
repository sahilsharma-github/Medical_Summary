I am pasting a PDF pet health report. Please analyze it and generate a summary in the following exact Markdown structure and order:

name: [extract the pet‚Äôs name from the report]
owner: [extract the owner‚Äôs name from the report]

Write:
"Hi ***[owner‚Äôs name]***, thanks for caring for ***[pet‚Äôs name]*** and getting these tests done."
Say a one-liner which encourages the owner for proactively checking their pet‚Äôs health.

Then give a 1‚Äì2 line overview of what this check-up covered (blood health, organ function, vitamins, infections, etc.).

‚úÖ Things that are in good shape

List all results that are within the healthy range.
For each, show the biomarker name, the measured value, and its plain-language meaning for pets.
Example:

Hemoglobin 14.2 ‚Üí supports good oxygen flow and energy for Bella

‚ö†Ô∏è Things that need attention

List all results that are outside or borderline of the normal range.
For each, show the biomarker name, the measured value, and a plain-language explanation.
Example:

Vitamin D 20.6 (Low) ‚Üí may reduce bone and immune strength in Max

üìù Next steps

Provide practical, non-medical suggestions the owner can discuss with their ***[use vet name from report]***.
Keep it supportive and simple, not clinical (e.g., diet tweaks, outdoor walks, hydration, check-ups).
